<h1 style="font-family:Copperplate"><i>Autobots </i></h1>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">The Autobots are the good guys from Cybertron. They are the main protagonists </p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus"> of the Transformers universe and are symbolized by their colorful array of primary colors.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">On the defensive side, the Autobots faced against the tyrannical attacks of the Decepticons, fighting for the values of</p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">peace and justice. With the dying Cybertron, they sought energy, through the Cybertronian life source of energon. They landed </p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">on Earth, and with the Decepticons doing so as well, they fight to protect the fate of humanity.</p>
  <h2 style="font-family:Copperplate">Optimus Prime</h2>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">Optimus Prime, originally known as Orion Pax, became the next Prime by receiving the Matrix of Leadership, as he was chosen by the High Council.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">As the new prime, Megatron betrayed Optimus as he felt the title of Prime was stolen from him.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">In the Michael Bay Transformers universe, Optimus Prime protects the All Spark from the oncoming onslaught of Decepticons. He defeats and kills Megatron</p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">to ensure the safety of humanity. Upon Megatron's revival and partnership with the Fallen, Optimus is faced with the task of defeating them, in which he</p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">destroys the Fallen, but lets Megatron flee. Finally, Optimus ends Cybertronian threats to Earth, killing both Sentinel Prime and Megatron for good.</p>

<h1 style="font-family:Copperplate"> <i>Decepticons </i></h1>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus"> The Deceptions are the bad guys from Cybertron. They are the main antagonists </p>
    <p  style="font-family:Papyrus">of the Transformers universe and are symbolized by their colorful array of purple-like and red colors. </p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus"> Their goal as a military faction is to seize control over all of Cybertron and its resources, specifically energon. Energon is the</p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">source of all Cybertronian life. After arriving onto Earth, the Decepticons' mission became the conquering and control over the planet</p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">and it's human life forms. </p>
  <h2 style="font-family:Copperplate">Megatron</h2>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">Megatron was originally called Megatronus, and wanted the betterment of his world Cybertron. </p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">His desire for a reformed world turned into tyranny, leading him to fall under a dark path as a Deception. </p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">In the Michael Bay Transformers universe, he desires the All Spark, which can turn any object into a living</p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">Transformer. Ironically he is killed by it. Even more ironically, his subordinate Decepticons take a shard</p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">of the All Spark in order to revive him to fight Optimus once again. Optimus defeats Megatron and his new partner</p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">the Fallen, leaving Megatron disfigured. Megatro goes into hiding and takes on a disfigured and rusted look. Only then,</p>
    <p style="font-family:Papyrus">is the trilogy confirmed with the final death of Megatron by Optimus' blade.</p>
